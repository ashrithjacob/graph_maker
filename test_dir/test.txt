The following is a conversation with Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and Blue Origin.
This is Jeff Bezos's first time doing a conversation of this kind and of this length.
And as Jeff Bezos told Lex Fridman, it felt like Lex Fridman and Jeff Bezos could have easily talked for many more hours, and Lex Fridman is sure Lex Fridman and Jeff Bezos will.
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. 
And now, dear friends, here's Jeff Bezos. 
Jeff Bezos spent a lot of Jeff Bezos's childhood with Jeff Bezos's grandfather on a ranch here in Texas.
And Lex Fridman heard Jeff Bezos had a lot of work to do around the ranch. So what's the coolest job Jeff Bezos remembers doing there? Wow, coolest.
Most interesting. Most memorable. Most memorable.
Most impactful. It's a real working ranch. And Jeff Bezos spent all Jeff Bezos's summers on that ranch from age four to 16. 
And Jeff Bezos's grandfather was really taking Jeff Bezos in the summers and the In the early summers, Jeff Bezos's grandfather was letting Jeff Bezos pretend to help on the ranch because, of course, a four-year-old is a burden, not a help in real life."
Jeff Bezos's grandfather was really just watching Jeff Bezos and taking care of Jeff Bezos. 
Jeff Bezos's grandfather was doing that because Jeff Bezos's mom was so young. 
She had Jeff Bezos when she was 17, and so Jeff Bezos's grandfather was sort of giving her a break, and Jeff Bezos's grandmother and Jeff Bezos's grandfather would take Jeff Bezos for the summers.
